# AUTOMATED-NGX-MARKET-DASHBOARD
Ever tried making sense of NGX daily reports?
I built a live Excel dashboard that turns raw Nigerian Stock Market data into instant insights.

🚩 Problem

NGX data comes as static, voluminous tables. Tracking trends, gainers/losers, and sector moves is manual and time-consuming.

🚀 Data Journey

Daily price lists from GTI Research

Weekly index data from NGX PDFs (2014–date)

Built Python parsers to extract & clean data

Automated pipeline → CSV → Excel Power Query → Dashboard

Now the process runs continuously — data flows in, dashboard updates, insights appear instantly.

📊 Dashboard Features

📊 KPI Cards – Traded Value, Volume, Deals, Advancers/Decliners

📈 Top Movers – Gainers, Losers, Most Traded

🔥 Trends – Candlesticks, price & volume charts

🏦 Sector Insights – NGX indices performance

🎛 Filters – Drill down by company, index, or date

🔹 Tools

Python | Excel (Pivot, Charts, Slicers) | Power Query

💥 Impact

Saves hours of manual sorting

Instant market intelligence

Scalable – auto-updates with new NGX data

✨ From static PDFs → to dynamic, automated insights.
